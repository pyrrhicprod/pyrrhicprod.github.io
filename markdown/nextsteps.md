# Options

### Our most agreed upon solution is to try to rewew until October

##Full List

* #### We do not extend our lease. We begin looking for a place to live in Seattle, and Nate determines an end date for work 
    * #### best bet would be to live with Claire's parents for a period of time
* #### Ask McGrath is we can extend to October. If yes, do so. If not, renew lease in full and immediately begin looking for sublet options
* #### Renew lease. Stay until Nate's sabatical. Determine if we are staying or going near then.
